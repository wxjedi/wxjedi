- 👋 Hi, I’m @wxjedi
- 👀 I’m interested in coding applications for meteorology and data, as well as areas such as AI and ML, as well as expanding my horizons by learning new programming languages.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and R, and considering picking up a new language.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a variety of things. I'm open-minded, so if you have any ideas, feel free to get in touch with me.
- 📫 How to reach me is through my website, which I am continuing to build out: [4metrix](4metrix.com)
